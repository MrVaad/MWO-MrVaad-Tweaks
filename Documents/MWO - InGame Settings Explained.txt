MrVaad - MWO Game Settings Explained - v0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a small guide to explain the differences when changing settings in the game.
To keep the guide simple, i'm just documenting those differences.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EFFECTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ragdoll : It is the animation when your mech dies. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnvyYg7tOJc

VERY HIGH : 
HIGH      : ragdoll distance, mintime, unseen time lowered
MEDIUM    : ragdoll distance, mintime, unseen time lowered
LOW       : ragdoll distance, mintime, unseen time lowered, player weapons lighteffects disabled (does it impact mech weapons ?)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECT DETAIL 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Object Quality : A visual effect *can* need a "minimum object quality" to be applied. I can't find which MWO effect needs an object quality.

LoD (Level of Detail) : Textures and/or geometry complexity, Goes From LoD0 (Max detail) to LoD1/LoD2 etc (https://docs.cryengine.com/display/SDKDOC2/Creating+LODs )
                        LoDs are used relatively to the distance between you and the object. 

VERY HIGH : Object quality set to 4

HIGH      : Object LoD distances lowered and Object Quality lowered to 3
            Vegetation View Distance lowered
			
MEDIUM    : Object LoD distances lowered and Object Quality lowered to 2,
			View distance lowered for Objects, Details and Vegetation
			Vegetation bending (ie grass animation) disabled
			Debris lifetime lowered
			Damage mask texture lowered
			
LOW       : Object LoD distances lowered and Object Quality lowered to 1,
            View distance lowered for Objects, Custom Objects, Details, Vegetation and lights (not the sun !)
			Vegetation Minimum Size augmented (will hide very small grass)
            Distance when 3D vegetation is converted to 2D lowered (is it used ?)
			Decals lifetime lowered (ie bullet impact, laser impact, footprints)
			Debris lifetime lowered
			
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PARTICLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Particle quality" is the most important. It has NO influence on the effects themselves.
But each particle effect needs a minimum "particle quality" to be displayed on screen.

VERY HIGH : Particle quality set to 4

HIGH      : Particle quality lowered to 3
			Particles motion blur disabled

MEDIUM    : Particle quality lowered to 2
            Max Particles on screen lowered
            Particles effects rendered at half resolution (only the ones using additive blending) 
			
LOW       : Particle quality lowered to 1
            Max Particles on screen lowered
			Particles min size augmented (before removed) 
			Particles lights disabled
			Soft particles disabled

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST PROCESSING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERY HIGH : 

HIGH      : Depth of Field simplified (Time of day Influence disabled)
            Frames Cached for 3D HUD post processing effects augmented

MEDIUM    : Frames Cached for 3D HUD post processing effects augmented

LOW       : Frames Cached for 3D HUD post processing effects augmented
            Sun shafts disabled
			
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHADING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shader quality goes from 1 to 3. This disables or simplify effects.

Most of the rendering techniques in CryEngine are done via shaders.
This can have a BIG impact on performance and visuals.

VERY HIGH : All Shaders quality set to 3 except postprocess and water set to 2 (they bug at 3)
HIGH      : All Shaders quality set to 2  
MEDIUM    : All Shaders quality set to 1 (except water)
LOW       : metal shader quality set to 0 (strange value ?)
			water shader quality lowered to 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHADOWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each type of object can have a different shadow distance.
Jiterring is shaking the edges of shadows and then you blur the result .

VERY HIGH : 

HIGH      : Shadows view distances lowered for all objects
			Shadows edges blur lowered
			Particles shadows disabled 

MEDIUM    : Shadows view distances lowered for all objects
			Shadows edges blur lowered
			Shadows jittering lowered
			Fog Shadows disabled
			
LOW       : Shadows disabled
				
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEXTURING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A texture Atlas is a BIG texture where you store multiple small ones (faster to read, copy etc)
Those max Atlas Sizes seem to be initial sizes, Atlas can still grow if needed.

Environment textures could be for the fake reflections on buildings, frozen water etc ?

VERY HIGH : Environment texture resolution set to 512x512

HIGH      : No differences from VERY HIGH 

MEDIUM    : Texture resolution halfed (from original size)
			Clouds texture resolution lowered

			Atlas Max Sizes for cloud textures, for sprites textures, lowered
			
			Environment cubemap texture resolution lowered
			Environment texture resolution set to 256x256 
			Environment texture Update Frequency lowered

			Dynamic Textures Max Size lowered (?)
			r_TexBumpResolution	lowered (?)

			
LOW       : Texture resolution quartered (from original size)
			Clouds texture resolution lowered
			Sky texture resolution lowered
			
			Atlas Max Sizes for cloud texture, for sprites texture, for general Textures, lowered			
						
			Environment cubemap texture resolution lowered
			Environment texture resolution set to 128x128
			Environment texture Update Frequency lowered

			Dynamic Textures Max Size lowered (?)
			r_TexBumpResolution	lowered (?)
			
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENVIRONMENT 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SSDO and SSAO are ambient occlusion method (see here for screenshots http://www.tweakguides.com/Crysis3_15.html)
In MWO, they don't have a big visual impact (if at all) but a big performance cost (mostly GPU)

VERY HIGH : 

HIGH      : water hardware tesselation disabled,
			SSDO disabled and SSA0 enabled
			
MEDIUM    : SSAO lowered,
			terrain texture detail lowered,

			water reflections update distance lowered,
			dynamic lights number lowered (not the sun)

			Per-pixel blending distance halfed (already very small, and can't see where it's used),
			
LOW       : SSAO disabled,
			terrain texture detail lowered,
			terrain geometry lowered,

			Global Illumination disabled,
			water caustics disabled,
			reflections disabled (doesn't seem used in MWO),
			water reflections update distance and frequency lowered,
			dynamic lights number lowered (not the sun)
